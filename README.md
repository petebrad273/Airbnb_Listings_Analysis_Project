# Airbnb Listings Analysis Project
## Objective
Airbnb has quickly become one of the most popular online marketplaces for lodging around the world. Los Angeles, California is home to one of the largest number of Airbnb properties in the United States.

Guest reviews play a critical role and are highly influential in future guest booking decisions. According to a Tripadvisor survey, 81% of travelers always or frequently read reviews before booking a place to stay.

This case study explores what factors may contribute to an Airbnb listings' number of reviews and provides a dashboard to serve as a planning tool for current and potential future hosts to view key listing statistics in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles.
